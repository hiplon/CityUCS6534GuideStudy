abstract = {LoRa, as a representative of Low Power Wide Area Network technology, has attracted significant attention from both academia and industry. However, the current understanding of LoRa is far from complete, and implementations have a large performance gap in SNR and packet reception rate. This article presents a comprehensive understanding of LoRa physical layer protocol (PHY) and reveals the fundamental reasons for the performance gap. We present the first full-stack LoRa PHY implementation with a provable performance guarantee. We enhance the demodulation to work under extremely low SNR (-20 dB) and analytically validate the performance, where many existing works require SNR &gt; 0. We derive the order and parameters of decoding operations, including dewhitening, error correction, deinterleaving, and so on, by leveraging LoRa features and packet manipulation. We implement a complete real-time LoRa on the GNU Radio platform and conduct extensive experiments. Our method can achieve (1) a 100\% decoding success rate while existing methods can support at most 66.7\%, (2) -142 dBm sensitivity, which is the limiting sensitivity of the commodity LoRa, and (3) a 3,600-m communication range in the urban area, even better than commodity LoRa under the same setting.},

abstract = {We evaluate the effectiveness of secret key extraction, for private communication between two wireless devices, from the received signal strength (RSS) variations on the wireless channel between the two devices. We use real world measurements of RSS in a variety of environments and settings. Our experimental results show that (i) in certain environments, due to lack of variations in the wireless channel, the extracted bits have very low entropy making these bits unsuitable for a secret key, (ii) an adversary can cause predictable key generation in these static environments, and (iii) in dynamic scenarios where the two devices are mobile, and/or where there is a significant movement in the environment, high entropy bits are obtained fairly quickly. Building on the strengths of existing secret key extraction approaches, we develop an environment adaptive secret key generation scheme that uses an adaptive lossy quantizer in conjunction with Cascade-based information reconciliation [7] and privacy amplification [14]. Our measurements show that our scheme, in comparison to the existing ones that we evaluate, performs the best in terms of generating high entropy bits at a high bit rate. The secret key bit streams generated by our scheme also pass the randomness tests of the NIST test suite [21] that we conduct.},

abstract = {The technology of visible light communication (VLC) is regarded as an appealing technique for upcoming wireless indoor multimedia communications. Considering the broadcast aspect of visible light propagation, the visible light interface is exposed and approachable to both licensed and unlicensed parties settled within the illuminated region. In this study, the authors present a chaos-based physical-layer encryption method for orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)-based VLC schemes with the ability to counter known-plaintext attacks (KPAs) and chosen-plaintext attacks (CPAs). A logistic map is utilised for the chaos mapping. The presented method produces dynamic ciphertexts by employing the random quality of the chaotic keys and input data. It uses a multiple-fold encryption protocol which implements chaotic scrambling of the subcarrier distribution in time and frequency domains, as well as chaotic polarity inversion of subcarriers. To generate the secret key, a chaotic key creation approach is introduced by including the position-sensitive and real-valued channel state information of the VLC channel. The presented method provides supreme confidentiality for the OFDM-based VLC schemes to counter KPAs, CPAs, brute-force attacks, and statistical attacks. The secrecy capacity of the presented method is improved by applying a pre-equalisation technique at the transmitter instead of the receiver.},
