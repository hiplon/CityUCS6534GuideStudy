\section{Deep-in-Building and Outdoor Test}
In this section, I conducted a test to generate LoRa physical layer keys in a practical application scenario. The test provided positive results, demonstrating the practical application of LoRa in real-world scenarios. Moreover, the findings are of significant reference value for the future utilization of the LoRa protocol in environmental monitoring.
