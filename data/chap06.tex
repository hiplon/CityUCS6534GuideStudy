\chapter{Conclusion and Future Work}
A concise summary of the study, and discussion of possible future work.

\section{Conclusion}
In this section, the main focus is on implementing the functions of LoRa nodes Alice and Bob through the Arduino programmable MCU board and IDE mentioned earlier, in conjunction with the LoRa frequency modulation chip and the algorithms mentioned above.

\section{Future Work}
In this section, I conducted a test to generate LoRa physical layer keys in a practical application scenario. The test provided positive results, demonstrating the practical application of LoRa in real-world scenarios. Moreover, the findings are of significant reference value for the future utilization of the LoRa protocol in environmental monitoring.
